- ✅ Bridge map overlay approach (no modification of hnswlib internals)
- ✅ TODO markers for dynamic insert functionality (as requested)

### Adaptive Multi-entry Seeds
- ✅ High-layer candidate selection from level ≥ 1
- ✅ Top-m seed selection with adaptive strategies
- ✅ Parallel beam search implementation
- ✅ Result merging and re-ranking
- ✅ Configurable parameters (m, beam_width, ef_search)

### Evaluation Framework
- ✅ Ground truth computation with FAISS
- ✅ Baseline vs optimized comparison
- ✅ Cost and recall measurement
- ✅ Percentile analysis (P10, P25, P50, P75, P90, P95, P99)
- ✅ Automated plotting and visualization
- ✅ CSV and JSON result export

## Technical Implementation Details

### Bridge Edge Scoring Function
```
S(u,v) = w1 × cross_modality_bonus + w2 × inverse_distance + w3 × complementarity - w4 × cost_penalty
```

### Multi-entry Search Strategy
1. Collect high-layer candidates using diverse search
2. Select top-m seeds using adaptive strategy
3. Execute parallel beam search from each seed
4. Merge and re-rank results

### Bridge Map Overlay Approach
- Bridge edges stored separately from core HNSW structure
- Bridge neighbors merged during search traversal
- Maintains compatibility with hnswlib
- Enables easy bridge management and validation

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Run tests
make test

# Run example
make run-example

# Run small experiment
make run-experiment
```

### Python API
```python
from hnsw_optimization import create_toy_dataset, HNSWBaseline, BridgeBuilder, MultiEntrySearch

# Create dataset
X, Q, modalities, query_modalities = create_toy_dataset(1000, 100, 64, 3)

# Build optimized HNSW
hnsw = HNSWBaseline(dimension=64, M=16, ef_construction=200)
hnsw.build_index(X)

bridge_builder = BridgeBuilder(bridge_budget_ratio=1e-5)
bridge_map = bridge_builder.build_bridges(hnsw, X, modalities)

multi_search = MultiEntrySearch(hnsw, bridge_builder)
neighbors, cost = multi_search.multi_entry_search(Q[0], k=10, m=4)
```

## Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `M` | 16 | HNSW connectivity |
| `ef_construction` | 200 | Construction search width |
| `bridge_budget_ratio` | 1e-5 | Bridge edge budget |
| `max_bridge_per_node` | 2 | Bridge limit per node |
| `m` (seeds) | 4 | Number of entry seeds |
| `target_recall` | 0.90 | Evaluation threshold |

## Dynamic Insert Implementation (TODO)

As requested, dynamic insertion logic is marked with TODO comments:

```python
# TODO: Dynamic insert bridge creation
# When implementing dynamic insertion, the following logic should be added:
# 
# 1. When a new vector is inserted:
#   - Determine its level in the HNSW hierarchy
#   - If it's inserted in a high layer (level > 0):
#     - Find its modality/cluster assignment
#     - Identify potential bridge candidates from other clusters
#     - Score and potentially add bridges following the same budget constraints
# 
# 2. Bridge validation:
#   - Periodically validate that bridge edges are still beneficial
#   - Remove bridges that become redundant or harmful
# 
# 3. Soft edges approach:
#   - Consider bridges as "soft" edges that can be easily removed
#   - Maintain separate bridge data structure that doesn't modify core HNSW
```

## Validation and Testing

- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality
- ✅ Bridge edge budget constraints validated
- ✅ Multi-entry search correctness verified
- ✅ Ground truth computation validated
- ✅ Statistical analysis framework tested

## Performance Considerations

- Bridge map overlay approach minimizes memory overhead
- Parallel search implementation for multi-entry seeds
- Mini-batch clustering for large datasets
- Efficient candidate generation and scoring
- Configurable parameters for different use cases

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. Limited access to hnswlib internal structure (mitigated with bridge map approach)
2. Simplified distance computations in some components
3. Dynamic insertion not implemented (marked as TODO per requirements)

### Future Enhancements
1. Native hnswlib integration with direct adjacency manipulation
2. Advanced scoring functions and adaptive parameters
3. GPU acceleration for distance computations
4. Incremental bridge edge maintenance

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully delivers all specified requirements:

- ✅ High-layer Bridge Edges with strict budget control
- ✅ Adaptive Multi-entry Seeds with parallel search
- ✅ Comprehensive evaluation framework
- ✅ Statistical analysis and visualization
- ✅ Complete test suite and documentation
- ✅ Dynamic insert logic marked as TODO (per requirements)

The project provides a solid foundation for HNSW optimization research and can be easily extended with additional features as needed.
